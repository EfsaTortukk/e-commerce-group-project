Hello, this is the project that we created with following a tutorial with my class group to complete e-commerce class in uni.

## Getting Started

So you need to start the MongoDB first, and create a database named " mongodb://localhost:27017/palmtechdb"

Then you can run the development server:

```bash
npm install

# and

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
